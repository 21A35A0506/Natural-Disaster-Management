        <h3>The Disaster Management Survey Questions is a questionnaire to collect information on the effect of disasters and crisis on communities and the steps they are taking to respond to disasters and how they can reduce the risk. The purpose of this survey is to identify the public awareness of disasters and the procedures they follow to respond to disasters. Disaster is a sudden occurrence that disrupts the functioning of the society and causes human, material, economic and environmental losses. Disaster is often caused by accident, but often it may have human roots. Disaster management is the coordination and management of resources and obligations. It refers to the procedures that a nation may perform to protect and conserve as much life and property as possible. There are different forms of disasters that can occur, such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, epidemics, etc. Such a study can help to explain how many people are knowledgeable of disaster management and can also be educated in various forms of disasters. This will also help to understand how much knowledge needs to be created to get most people ready and prepared for disasters.
    Disasters can be very tragic and can have a very significant effect. They would leave a trail of injury, death, loss of livestock, loss of property and economic losses. The incident with the highest death toll since 1980 was the Boxing Day tsunami in South East Asia, which killed 220,000 people. In 2017, 335 natural disasters affected 95.6 million people, 9697 deaths and a cumulative cost of $335 billion. In Asia, the majority of disasters are floods and storms, with 44% of all disasters, 58% of total deaths and 70% of total people affected. Despite all this, America has recorded the highest economic losses, accounting for 88 per cent of the overall cost of 94 disasters.
    
        Following are the questions to gather information about disaster management knowledge and preparedness for any disasters.</h3>

        <h1>Questionnaire on crisis management, disaster management and fire and emergency exit plans.</h1><br>
        <fieldset>
        <p class="par"><b>1. Why mobile satellite communications an essential component for all critical network planning?
           </b></p>
           <p class="par"> To enable rapid deployment and/or restoration and truly mobile communications, emergency personnel and first responders should incorporate Globalstar satellite services as a redundancy requirement in any communications network or architecture.  A satellite system should be included in the early planning of these initiatives to ensure there is a backup communications solution. Without a satellite component to any future emergency response communications network, emergency communications will be rendered useless when the terrestrial network sustains damage or is overloaded.
             
            Globalstar is here to help you implement your company’s ability to address interoperability & operability requirements before, during and after disasters and support your organization’s needs for mobile satellite communications, safety and emergency management initiatives for all offices and operations.</p><br>

            <p class="par"><b>2. How prepared is your organization?
                Would your organization be able to communicate during and after a disaster?  If terrestrial systems went down – landlines, cellular service and the Internet – how capable would your organization be?</b></p>
            <p class="par"> Land-based communications infrastructure may be damaged or destroyed by storms, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other disasters. Satellite solutions are not vulnerable to these events, which is why they are key to any emergency preparedness and disaster recovery plan.</p><br>
