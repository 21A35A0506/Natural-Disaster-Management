        <p class="par">East Godavari District, one of the nine coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, is a regular victim of multiple disasters and this district was badly affected by all major natural disasters time to time since independent era. Hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. For instance, it could be a cyclone followed by floods. Sometimes natural hazards may get augmented by human activities. For instance, natural coastal erosion by wave action may increase due to cutting down of mangroves. The risk from hazards is characterized by the frequency of occurrence and severity of the hazard. For example tsunamis are rare events with moderate to severe consequences. Mild flooding may occur frequently, while severe flooding may be an infrequent event. Coastal erosion may be a chronic event with mild consequences or, coupled with other hazards, may result in severe impacts on the shoreline. Infrequent events with limited predictability pose the greatest risk of disaster and the longest time needed for disaster recovery. Frequent or ongoing hazards such as resource or environmental degradation processes can be monitored to reduce risk.</p>
          <h2>The prominent natural and manmade hazards in the district are as below:</h2>

            <p class="par">Krishna district falls in Zone II (least active seismic zone) and Zone III (moderate seismic zone) as per 
                the latest Seismic Zoning Map of India. 95% of the total area and 96% of the total population of the 
                district is vulnerable to Zone III seismicity; while only 5% of the total area and 4% of the total 
                population of the district is vulnerable to Zone II seismicity.</p>

                    the east coast. The district experiences severe floods and water logging along the banks of river 
                    Krishna and other low lying areas during monsoon season of the year</br>Flooding is also common in the district. There are two rivers which flow through the district. The 
                    Krishna River which is flows through southern part of the district and Budameru River on the northwest. Both these rivers contribute to the canal network. In the past four decades the district due to

                    the Wind and Cyclone Hazard Map of India, Krishna lies in Moderate Risk Zone – A (Vb = 44m/s) and 
                    Very High Damage Risk Zone – B (Vb = 50m/s). 
                    The following table lists the blocks that fall in either of cyclone hazard zones, area of each block in 
                    each of the hazard zones and population in these blocks vulnerable to cyclones. 70% area of the 
                    district and 75% of the population is vulnerable to “Moderate Risk Zone – A (Vb = 44m/s)”. While
