                <p class="par">Mild flooding may occur frequently, while severe flooding may be an infrequent event. Coastal erosion may be a chronic event with mild consequences or, coupled with other hazards, may result in severe impacts on the shoreline. Infrequent events with limited predictability pose the greatest risk of disaster and the longest time needed for disaster recovery. Frequent or ongoing hazards such as resource or environmental degradation processes can be monitored to reduce risk.Nellore is recently (Nov 20, 2015) affected by severe floods caused by heavy rainfall and 
                    at least 35 people have been reported to have lost their lives.</p>
