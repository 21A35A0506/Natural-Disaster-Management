        <p class="par">Cyclone, Floods, drought and heat wave are the major natural hazards prominent in the district. Real-time monitoring and early warning systems to be put in place and ensure disaster management awareness and evacuation strategies are common knowledge in the disaster-prone mandals. Flood warning issued by the Indian Metrological Department has to be disseminated by the State Government to all districts and mandals in a timely manner. Management of Heat wave related deaths is crucial for the district and can be carried with the assistance of Andhra Pradesh State Development Planning Society during critical times.<br>

            kurnnol District lies in the Rayalaseema region of AP and has been identified as generally drought prone. While approximately more than 50% population of the entire district lies in moderate drought risk zone, one mandal has been identified as severe drought prone. Drought is slow onset disaster and is difficult to demarcate onset and end date. Drought does not cause any structural damage but results in crop failure, increase in energy consumption to pump water, health risks, increased unemployment, increased poverty, distressed sale of assets and distress migration.</p>
