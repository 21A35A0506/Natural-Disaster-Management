        <p class="par">There is a paradigm shift in Disaster Management approach from the earlier
            focus of response and relief to prevention and preparedness. It is certainly possible
            to reduce the impact of Disasters by evolving appropriate preparedness, mitigation
            and response plans. Earlier, any disaster management was considered as a crisis
            management function that began with a disaster and closed soon after the relief
            and rehabilitation. It is now realized that process of mitigation should incorporate
            long term preventive and protective measures by adopting appropriate strategies
            for disaster prone areas. The mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)
            features into development planning of sectoral departments is one of the key areas
            identified and incorporated in the plan. The GOI-UNDP DRR Programme envisages a
            holistic and integrated approach.</p>

            <p class="par">The district falls in Zone II (least active seismic zone) and Zone III (moderate seismic 
                zone) as per the latest Seismic Zoning Map of India. 91% of the total area and 95% of the 
                total population of the district falls in Zone II; while 9% of the total area and 5% of the total 
                population falls in Zone III.</p>
                <h1> Floods in Kadapa District:</h1>
                <img style="float: right" src="flood kadapa.jpeg".jpeg" class="pass" width="400" height="300"/> 
                <p class="par">Floods are characterized as any high stream flow which overlap natural or artificial 
                    banks of a river or a stream and are markedly higher than the usual; and the inundation of 
                    low lands. Sometimes copious monsoon rains combined with massive outflows from the 
                    rivers cause devastating floods. Flooding is caused by the inadequate capacity within the 
                    banks of the rivers to contain the high flows brought down from the upper catchment due 
                    to heavy rainfall. Areas having poor drainage characteristics get flooded by accumulation of 
                    water from heavy rainfall. Flooding is accentuated by erosion and silting of the river beds 
                    resulting in reduction of carrying capacity of river channel, earthquakes and landslides 
                    leading to changes in river courses, obstructions to flow, synchronization of floods in the 
                    main and tributary rivers and retardation due to tidal effects.</p>
                <h1>Cyclones in Kadapa District:</h1>

                <p class="par">As per the Wind and Cyclone Hazard Map of India, Kadapa lies in Low Damage Risk 
                    Zone – A (Vb = 33m/s), Moderate Damage Risk Zone – B (Vb = 39m/s) and Moderate

                    The following table lists the blocks that fall in either of cyclone hazard zones, area of 
                    each block in each of the hazard zones and population in these blocks vulnerable to 
                    cyclones. 14% area of the district and 13% of population is vulnerable to “Low Damage

                    <h1>Heat Waves in Kadapa District:</h1>
                <img style="float: right" src="heatwave kadapa.jpeg" class="pass" width="400" height="300"/> 
                <p class="par">Heat wave: Heat-wave is a condition of atmospheric temperature that leads to physiological 
                    stress, which sometimes can claim human life. Heat-wave is defined as the condition where 
                    maximum temperature at a grid point is 3˚C or more than the normal temperature, consecutively 
                    for 3 days or more. World Meteorological Organization defines a heat wave as five or more 
                    consecutive days during which the daily maximum temperature exceeds the average maximum 
                    temperature by five degrees Celsius. If the maximum temperature of any place continues to be 
                    more than 45° C consecutively for two days, it is called a heat wave condition. There will be no 
                    harm to the human body if the environmental temperature remains at 37° C. Whenever the 
                    environmental temperature increases above 37° C, the human body starts gaining heat from the 
                    atmosphere. If humidity is high, a person can suffer from heat stress disorders even with the 
                    temperature at 37°C or 38°C. To calculate the effect of humidity we can use Heat Index Values. 
                    The Heat Index is a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with 
                    the actual air temperature. As an example, if the air temperature is 34°C and the relative 
                    humidity is 75%, the heat index--how hot it feels--is 49°C. The same effect is reached at just 31°C 
                    when the relative humidity is 100 %.</p>
