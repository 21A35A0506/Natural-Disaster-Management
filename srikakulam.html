        <p class="par">Srikakulam District is one of the nine coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, is a regular victim of multiple disasters and this district was badly affected by all major natural disasters time to time since independent era. Hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. For instance, it could be a cyclone followed by floods. Sometimes natural hazards may get augmented by human activities. For instance, natural coastal erosion by wave action may increase due to cutting down of mangroves. The risk from hazards is characterized by the frequency of occurrence and severity of the hazard. For example tsunamis are rare events with moderate to severe consequences. Mild flooding may occur frequently, while severe flooding may be an infrequent event. Coastal erosion may be a chronic event with mild consequences or, coupled with other hazards, may result in severe impacts on the shoreline. Infrequent events with limited predictability pose the greatest risk of disaster and the longest time needed for disaster recovery. Frequent or ongoing hazards such as resource or environmental degradation processes can be monitored to reduce risk.</p>

                the Earthquake, the district has highest magnitude 5.0 and 3.8 on rector scale in the years 1858 and

                    or 3 times flash floods occurring in the Srikakulam district due to heavy rainfall of south west monsoon 
                    period. The flood condition in the district chiefly depends upon the rain fall received in the catchments area 
                    of Odissa State. Since 1980, 12 Flash floods occurred out of which 3 affected severely.

                <h1>Cyclones in Srikakulam District:</h1>
                <img style="float: right" src="cyclone srikakulam.jpeg" class="pass" width="400" height="300"/> 
                <p class="par">The district of Srikakulam has been historically affected by multiple perils such as cyclone, flood, 
                    heat wave, earthquakes and others.
                    Srikakulam is a coastal district in Andhra Pradesh which is frequently subjected to cyclones and 
                    storm surge. As per the Wind and Cyclone Hazard Map of India, Srikakulam lies in Moderate Risk 
                    Zone – A (Vb = 44m/s) and Very High Damage Risk Zone – B (Vb = 50m/s). 
                    The following table lists the blocks that fall in either of cyclone hazard zones, area of each block in 
                    each of the hazard zones and population in these blocks vulnerable to cyclones. 21% area of the 
                    district and 14% of population is vulnerable to “Moderate Risk Zone – A (Vb = 44m/s)”. And, 79% 
                    area of the district and 86% of the total population is vulnerable to “Very High Damage Risk Zone 
                    – B (Vb = 50m/s).”
                    Zone Vb = 44m/s is Moderate Damage Risk Zone – A
                    Zone Vb = 50m/s is Very High Damage Risk Zone - B

                    <h1>Heat Waves in Srikakulam District:</h1>
                <img style="float: right" src="heatwave srikakulam.jpeg" class="pass" width="400" height="300"/> 
                <p class="par">Heat-wave is a condition of atmospheric temperature that leads to physiological stress, which 
                    sometimes can claim human life. Heat-wave is defined as the condition where maximum 
                    temperature at a grid point is 3˚C or more than the normal temperature, consecutively for 3 days 
                    or more. World Meteorological Organization defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive 
                    days during which the daily maximum temperature exceeds the average maximum temperature 
                    by five degrees Celsius. If the maximum temperature of any place continues to be more than 45° 
                    C consecutively for two days, it is called a heat wave condition. There will be no harm to the 
                    human body if the environmental temperature remains at 37° C. Whenever the environmental 
                    temperature increases above 37° C, the human body starts gaining heat from the atmosphere. If 
                    humidity is high, a person can suffer from heat stress disorders even with the temperature at 
                    37°C or 38°C. To calculate the effect of humidity we can use Heat Index Values. The Heat Index is 
                    a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air 
                    temperature. As an example, if the air temperature is 34°C and the relative humidity is 75%, the 
                    heat index--how hot it feels--is 49°C.</p>
                <h1>Droughts in Srikakulam District:</h1>
                
                <img style="float: right" src="drought srikakulam.jpeg" class="pass" width="400" height="300"/> 
                 <p class="par">The impact of weather hazards, which include floods, droughts, hailstorms and storms, are devastative 
                    and dislocate the ecosystems especially agriculture on which entire economy and development of a 
                    region depends. This leads to migration of people from affected areas in search of livelihood, which 
                    further causes imbalance of social conditions (Satyanarayana et al, 2002). Among the weather hazards, 
                    droughts are usually defined as periods of dryness due to lack of rain. Drought has many definitions 
                    based on different perspectives. It is an interval of time, generally of the order of months or years in 
                    duration, during which the actual moisture supply at a given place, rather consistently falls short of the 
                    climatically expected (Palmer, 1965). According to Takeuchi (1974), drought is a condition whenever the 
                    amount of water, which has been expected and relied upon for use in any of man’s activities, cannot be 
                    met for some reason. McMahon and Diaz Arenas (1982) defined drought as an extended period of 
                    deficient rainfall relative to the average for a region. Beran and Rodier (1985) assessed drought with a 
                    chief characteristic of decrease of water availability in a particular period and over a particular area. 
                    According to Ben-Zvi (1987) drought is a severe shortage in the appearance of natural waters with 
                    respect to normal.
                    Srikakulam District experiences wide variability in rainfall and susceptible to drought. The most severe 
                    drought years in the district are 1999, 2002, 2003 and 2004
