        <p class="par">Disaster management has moved from a reactive and relief-centric approach to a 
            holistic and integrated approach covering prevention and preparedness
            measures in the pre-disaster phase; and mitigation, rehabilitation and
            reconstruction measures in the post-disaster phase. Andhra Pradesh is
            vulnerable to major natural disasters like cyclones, floods, earthquakes and
            droughts, as well as man-made disasters. The Revenue Department of Andhra 
            Pradesh is Nodal Department for Disaster Management (DM) in State, shoulders 
            the responsibility of providing immediate relief to the people affected by various 
            calamities such as floods, droughts, cyclones, hailstorms, earthquakes, fire 
            accidents, etc. It also takes initiatives for relief, rescue, rehabilitation &
            restoration work.</p>

                <h1> Disaster Declaration
                </h1>
                <p class="pr"> The Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) will inform the State 
                    government to declare any area where cyclone had occurred or likely to occur as disaster affected 
                    area on the recommendations of the State Relief Commissioner or the District Collector. The 
                    purpose of declaration of disaster is to organize effective response in managing the effects of 
                    cyclone. Such a declaration provides wide powers and responsibilities to the State Relief 
                    Commissioner as per the Disaster Management ACT, 2005 and the District Collectors in order to 
                    handle the incident effectively.

                <p class="pg"><bold>"L"</bold> concept has been developed to define different levels of disasters in order to facilitate the 
                    responses and assistances to States and Districts.<br><br>
                    <bold>"L0"</bold>level denotes normal times which will be utilized for close monitoring, documentation, 
                    prevention and preparatory activities. Training on search and rescue, rehearsals, evaluation and 
                    inventory updation for response activities will be carried out during this time.<br><br>
                    <bold>"L1"</bold> level specifies disaster that can be managed at the District level; however, the State and 
                    Centre will remain in readiness to provide assistance if needed<br><br>
                    <bold>"L2"</bold>level disaster situations are those, which require assistance and active participation of the 
                    State, mobilization of its resources for management of disasters.<br><br>
                    <bold>"L3"</bold> level disaster situation is in case of largescale disaster where the State and District authorities 
                    have been overwhelmed and require assistance from the Central Government for reinstating the 
                    State and District machinery as well as for rescue, relief, other response and recovery measures. 
                    In most cases, the scale and intensity of the disaster as determined by the concerned technical
                    agency like IMD are sufficient for the declaration of L3 disaster<br><br>
