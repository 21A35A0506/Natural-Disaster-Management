## Project Description

The main idea of this project is create an Awareness on Natural Disasters.
we developed an Information Portal On Natural Disaster Management where it contains info about Natural Disasters in Andhrapradesh, and preventive measures to be taken in case of Natural Disasters and Damages caused by the Natural Disaster. 

Disaster management occupies an important place in this country's policy framework as it is the poor and the under-privileged who are worst affected on account of calamities/disasters. The steps being taken by the Government emanate from the approach outlined above.

The approach has been translated into a National Disaster Framework [a roadmap] covering institutional mechanisms, disaster prevention strategy, early warning system, disaster mitigation, preparedness and response and human resource development. !


Over the past couple of years, the Government of India have brought about a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management. The new approach proceeds from
the conviction that development cannot be sustainable unless disaster mitigation is built into the development process. 


Another corner stone of the approach is that mitigation has to be multi-disciplinary spanning across all sectors of development. The new policy also emanates from the belief that investments in mitigation are much more cost effective than expenditure on relief and rehabilitation.
